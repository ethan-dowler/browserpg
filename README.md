Working title: **Dungeons of Tairos**

## Premise

The entrance to a dark and mysterious dungeon has erupted from the ground at the center of the continent of Tairos.

No one knows why it appeared, but it’s clear that it’s dangerous. Monsters emerge from it daily.

Players take characters through the dungeon, layer by layer, until they find and defeat the source of the corruption.

Lower floors have more complicated layouts and tougher enemies.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to build a text-based RPG that's designed **for the browser** with an emphasis on the mobile browser experience.

I want to pick up exactly where I left off and play for whatever length of time I have available.

## Motivations

So many games have fancy graphics and epic soundtracks, but I don't always have time to sit down and play a game for hours at a time. I want a game that I can pick up and put down instantly.

Aside from the actual gameplay, I've been very interested in building a game with Ruby and/or Rails for a long time. As a professional RoR developer and avid gaming fan, it's exciting to combine one of my favorite hobbies with my professional skill set.
